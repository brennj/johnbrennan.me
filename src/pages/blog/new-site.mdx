title: I built a new site using Gatsby!

I moved my old, untouched site onto Gatsby and Netilfy so that I can write posts. I'm pretty pleased with this move because before I had a _plain_ create-react-app. It was not for the purpose of just blogging. It is more suited for a single page application. I was also using Zeit now deployments. It was fine, but whenever my site wasn't touched for a long time, it took ages for the site to get hot again and not take a while to spin up. With Netilfy, my site is buttery smooth and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. It's a great product.

Gatsby, even though I'm super late to the party to say this: is amazing. It has a lot of functionality out of the box so that I can just focus on writing - yet still have the complete flexibility that you wouldn't normally get with a traditional CMS like WordPress. I can customize everything and feel at home writing in React.

I'm going to experiment using this to document more learnings as I go on. I transferred my post concerned about testing UI from Medium. I'm going to tweak more and more and see what I can do with it.
