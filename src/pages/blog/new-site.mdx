title: I built a new site using Gatsby!

I spent a couple of hours spinning up this new Gatsby blog. It was a pleasant experience to work with the ecosystem and they have so many things catered for but still offer a massive amount of flexibility.

## The tech

I moved my old, untouched site onto Gatsby and Netilfy so that I can write posts. I'm pretty pleased with this move because before I had a _plain_ create-react-app.
It was not for the purpose of just blogging. It is more suited for a single page application. I was also using Zeit now deployments.
It was fine, but whenever my site wasn't touched for a long time, it took ages for the site to get hot again and not take a while to spin up.
With Netilfy, my site is buttery smooth and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. It's a great product.

I'm useless at design, so I opted for most of the defaults provided in the starter template provided by Gatsby when you spin up a new project.
I want to keep it pretty simple until there is more content in the site where I need to do something more.
There was a little bit of CSS I needed to touch. I opted for `styled-components` and `styled-system` for this. Mostly just for consistent spacing as much as possible.
I've always loved `styled-components` for anything I've done because it made sense to me when doing reusable component stuff with React. Styled system seems to really help take it to the next level.
I'd love to see it in use in a real, customer facing project.

Gatsby, even though I'm super late to the party to say this: is amazing.
It has a lot of functionality out of the box so that I can just focus on writing - yet still have the complete flexibility that you wouldn't normally get with a traditional CMS like WordPress. I can customize everything and feel at home writing in React.

I'm going to experiment using this to document more learnings as I go on. I transferred my post concerned about testing UI from Medium. I'm going to tweak more and more and see what I can do with it.

Feature wish list that I'll tackle as I make more content:

- Ability to like and comment articles.
- Newsletter signup.
- Add social/contact sections.
- Tagging of articles, pagination (need to learn more about GraphQL which I think will make this possible!)
- Search functionality, only if theres enough content where that is warranted! ðŸ˜€

I'm writing my posts in `.mdx` format because it's so cool to be able to embed React components in my Markdown, it's a good mix when you want to add something interactive in your posts. Which I'd like to do!

## The softer side

I want to document more. This is advice from _Gary Vaynrchuk_. Hes a cool entrepreneur. I often dream about making documents like these by often decide not to. Why? Because I feel like I don't have anything to say. Why would anyone want to listen to me? But thats the negative side of me that I want to not listen to. I want to create content that I hope could provide some value. I'd like to write a bit more about the frontend engineering landscape. I'll blog a bit about my personal development. Moreso just for my own sake, whether it'll be benefit to anyone else.
