### Whats up sugar tits?

I love sugar. I find comfort in a big bar of Cadbruys Dairy Milk: Fruit & Nut and a bottle of Coca Cola. Being someone who finds it easy to get stressed, I eat my feelings to cope. I know sugar is bad for me. But it's so good. It fills a void!

I need to get a bit of a grip though. Be a bit more of an adult. I'm not particularly happy how its my gut reaction to reach for crap and how it makes make my body look. I struggle with self discipline. I want to report my progress on trying to build that self discipline up a small bit. I've given up fizzy drinks for the last 50~ days and on the cusp of finishing 30 days of no sugary treats.

What motivates me to want to change is to look and feel a bit better about myself. I don't want to rely on filling with that void with bad shit. The guilt after binging on chocolate fucking sucks.

I've tried before a few times to curb these bad habits. By putting all my energy to eating cleaner and going to the gym. It works for awhile and it's great! I lose weight and feel good. Though, once the motivation usually dies out - I've found it very hard to maintain. It's not fun. In my attempts last year, I would do well for a couple of weeks. Then, life happened and I got sick! It was easier to fall back into old patterns of unregulated eating. I'm an impatient person. A sucker for instant gratification.

In retrospect, why I failed before is that I took too much on. I burned out quick. Not having clear cut focus with a very defined task isn't a strategy that works for me. Trying to flick a switch and become better is too hard. It seems "slow and steady wins the race" applies here. At least, based on what my last two months have been like. Not to say I won't fail again, but I definitely feel like I've clicked with my current approach.

  I read an article by Steve Pavlina. Steve is fucking crazy, and I've always
  respected him since I stumbled upon his blog when I around 15/16. He was a big
  influence in my life and shaped a lot of my opinions on becoming a goal
  orientated and ambitious person. He made this post focused on{" "}

  . Define your goal to be crystal clear. So that it could be a legally binding
  contract, you will find a way to wriggle out and fail. Steve often stresses
  the idea that you shouldn't try and make/break more than 1 habit at a time.
  This resonated with me. No room for ambiguity and focus on one thing sounded
  like something I could manage.

The kick up the arse that pushed me to pursue this is wanting to be a best partner I can be for my boyfriend. He is great and I want to be that too for him. So I said fuck it, I'll do it.

### No sugary drinks

I started with a commitment that I wouldn't consume any sugary/fizzy drinks for 30 days. I thought this was going to be manageable. I had done it before where I didn't consume them for a couple of months when I was in university. Lunchtime had developed into a bad pattern. I had a tendency to include a bottle of Coke or Coke Zero in with my food. I also knew I could do with less Starbucks drinks. The rules were:

The following weren't permitted:

- Any fizzy drinks. (Including Coke/Coke Zero/Diet Coke/7up/7up Free/anything else that related to this. All my favourites.)
- Alcohol (except a single glass of red wine at dinners, to cover myself. To not feel awkward for not drinking when at social events)
- No Starbucks drinks that were over 60 calories.

The following I could drink:

- Water (with diluted blackcurrant if out at a social event)
- Tea (Unsweetened iced, or hot with milk)
- Red wine under given restrictions outlined above.
- Starbucks drinks under 60 calories.

I'm not a coffee drinker so thats why there is no mention of it there. The alcohol restriction also wouldn't be difficult as I rarely consume it. The rest though, I knew it would need keeping focused. I left the small bit of breathing room for the red wine and Starbucks low calorie drinks. This was because I was going to be away in Portugal for a holiday. I wrote up these rules on a piece of paper and hung it up on my wardrobe. I could see it with the days of the month also written in a make-shift calendar. When a day was complete, I'd cross it off.

The experiment itself was a success. The hardest was remembering and beating the cravings during lunchtimes in work. The first few days were very tough, dying to go back to my old ways. But having the 'contract' written mean't I had no room for negotiation. It kept me on the right path and avoided tripping up. The breathing room was great for keeping sane in Portugal. That was only place where I availed of anything other than water. The cravings themselves went away around three weeks in. Social events were the places I felt the most awkward about it. In general, I'm an awkward person - but lack of alcohol made it worse. I managed though. I started the challenge on the 3rd of June 2019 and I'm still going strong!

### 30 days no sugary treats

With the success of the last challenge giving me momentum, I knew I could take it to the next level. I needed to tackle my loves. Chocolate. Jellies. Crisps. Desserts. Caramel. It killed me the thought of having to do it, but I knew it was for a longer term good of my health. I felt fucking good cutting fizzy drinks for a month. I wanted the challenge of no sugary treats in general.

As of writing today, I'm 26 days in. It was a similar pattern to what it was like giving up fizzy drinks. Lunchtimes are hard, because I'd have a bar of chocolate with my food. I'd often snack on chocolate after work, picking it up from the shop on the way home. Work has also been tough. I have to decline baked goods and avoid the communal kitchen when theres sweets around. But it gets easier and easier as the days get ticked off the piece of paper. It takes focus. But having the piece of paper stuck on my wardrobe is such a massive daily motivator. I haven't gotten anything like headaches or anything. The most surprising thing was the number of sugar related nightmares I was having. There, I ate sweets in the dream and felt an immense guilt.

### Going forward

The results so far have been good. I've lost a bit of weight without much change in my diet other than the removal of sugary treats/drinks. Not much, but noticeable enough that I feel a bit better about buying clothes to celebrate. I still eat bad and it is the next thing I want to focus on. One step at a time though. I haven't been snacking between main meals, where it would be only sweets.

I'm pleased so far. I am going to continue trying out things on a 30 day trial basis. As mentioned - the next I'm planning to tackle is to avoid eating takeaway dinner or lunches for August. I'll post a bit about it here in future! Laser cut focus is the key for me, and what was able to be the switch where I felt like this is going to work long term.
