### Whats up sugar tits?

I love sugar. I find comfort in a big bar of _Cadbruys Dairy Milk: Fruit & Nut_ and a bottle of _Coca Cola_. Being someone who finds it easy to get stressed, I eat my feelings to cope. I know sugar is bad for me. But it's just so good. It fills a void!

I need to get a bit of a grip though. Be a bit more of an adult. I'm not particularly happy how its my gut reaction to reach for crap and how it makes make my body look. I struggle with self discipline, and I want to report my progress on trying to build that self discipline up a small bit. I've given up fizzy drinks for the last 50~ days and nearly finished 30 days of no sugary treats.

What motivates me to want to change is to look and feel a bit better about myself. I don't want to rely on filling with that void with bad shit. The guilt after binging on chocolate fucking sucks.

I've tried before a few times to curb these bad habits. By putting all my energy to eating cleaner and going to the gym. It works for awhile and it's great! I lose weight and I feel good. Though, once the motivation usually dies out - I've found it very hard to maintain. It's not fun. In my attempts last year, I would do really well for a couple of weeks. Then, life happened and I got sick! It was easier to fall back into old patterns of unregulated eating. I'm an impatient person. A sucker for instant gratification.

In retrospect, why I think I failed before is that I took too much on. I burned out quick. Not having clear cut focus with a very defined task isn't a strategy that works for me. Trying to flick a switch and become better is too hard. It seems _"slow and steady wins the race"_ applies here bigtime, based on what my last two months have been like. Not to say I might not fail again, but I definitely feel like I've _clicked_ with my current approach for trying to instill better eating habits.

I read an article by _Steve Pavlina_. Steve is fucking crazy, and I've always respected him since I stumbled upon his blog when I around 15/16. He was a big influence in my life and shaped a lot of my opinions on becoming a goal orientated and ambitious person. He made [this post](www.google.com) focused on why you were failing your trails. The message of it essentially was: unless you have defined your goal so crystal clear, it could be compared to a legally binding contract, you will find a way to wriggle out and fail. Steve often stresses the idea that you shouldn't try and make/break more than 1 habit at a time. This resonated with me. No room for ambiguity and focus on one thing sounded like something I could manage.

The kick up the arse that pushed me to pursue this is wanting to be a best partnerÂ I can be for my boyfriend. He is great and I want to be that too for him. So I said fuck it, lets do it.

### No sugary drinks

I started with a commitment that I wouldn't consume any sugary/fizzy drinks for 30 days. I thought this was going to be managable because I had done it previously where I didn't consume them for a couple of months when I was in university. Lunchtime had developed into a bad pattern where I had a tendencdy to include a bottle of Coke or Coke Zero in with my food. I also knew I could do with less Starbucks drinks. The rules were:

The following weren't permitted:

- Any fizzy drinks. (Including Coke/Coke Zero/Diet Coke/7up/7up Free/anything else that related to this. All my favourites essentially)
- Alcohol (except a single glass of red wine at dinners, just to cover myself and not feel socially awkward for not drinking when at social events)
- No starbucks drinks that were over 60 calories. Espesically no Frappichinos.

The following I was permitted to drink:

- Water (with diluted blackcurrant if out at a social event)
- Tea (Unsweeted iced, or regularly hot with milk)
- Red wine under given portion controls outlined above.
- Starbucks drinks under 60 calories.

I'm not a coffee drinker so thats why there is no mention of it there. The alcohol restriction also wouldn't be difficult as I rarely consume it. The rest though, I knew it would require keeping focused. I left the small bit of breathing room for the red wine and Starbucks low carlorie drinks since I was going to be away in Portugal for a holiday. I wrote up these rules on a piece of paper and hung it up on my wardrobe so that I could see it with the days of the month also written in a make-shift calendar. When a day was completed, I'd cross it off.

The experiment itself was a success. The hardest was remembering and beating the cravings during lunchtimes in work. The first few days were very tough, dying to go back to my old ways. But having the 'contract' written mean't I had no room for neogiation and it kept me on the right path and avoided tripping up. The breathing room was great for keeping sane in Portugal. That was only place where I availed of anything other than water. The cravings themselves went away mostly around week three. Social events were the places I felt the most awkward about it. In general, I'm just a socially awkward person - but lack of alcohol made it worse. I managed though. I started the challenge on the 3rd of June 2019 and thankfully I'm still going strong!

### 30 days no sugary treats

With the success of the last challenge giving me momentum, I knew I could take it to the next level. I needed to tackle my loves. Chocolate. Jellies. Crisps. Desserts. Caramel. It killed me the thought of having to do it, but I knew it was for a longer term good of my health. I felt really fucking good cutting fizzy drinks for a month, and wanted the challenge of no sugary treats in general.

As of writing today, I'm 25 days in. It was a similar pattern to what it was like giving up fizzy drinks. Lunchtimes are hard, because I'd have a bar of chocolate with my food. I'd often snack on chocolate after work, picking it up from the shop on the way home. Work has also been tough, having to decline baked goods and avoid the communal kitchen when theres sweets around. But it gets easier and easier as the days get ticked off the piece of paper. It took focus, but again - having the piece of paper stuck on my wardrobe is such a massive motivator when you wake up and look at it every morning. I haven't gotten anything like headaches or anything. The most surprising thing was the number of sugar related nightmares I was having, where I ate sweets in the dream and felt insanely guilty in the dream.

### Going forward

The results so far have been really good. I've lost a bit of weight without much change in my diet other than the removal of sugary treats/drinks. Not much, but noticeable enough that I feel a bit better about buying clothes to celebrate. I still eat badly and it is the next thing I want to focus on. One step at a time though. I haven't really been snacking between main meals, where apparently it would be only sweets.

I'm pleased so far. I am going to continue trying out things on a 30 day trial basis, as mentioned - the next I'm planning to tackle is to avoid eating takeaway dinner or lunches for the month of August. I'll post a bit about it here in future! Laser cut focus is the key for me, and what was able to be the switch where I felt like this is going to work long term.
